	<h1>What is a Palindrome?</h1>
	<p>A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar. There are also numeric palindromes, particularly date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020. Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".</p>
